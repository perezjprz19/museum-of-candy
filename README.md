# museum-of-candy

This was a capstone project to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap from Colt Steele's 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. 


## Tools Used

* Bootstrap
* semantic HTML
* vanilla JS
  
## What I Learned

* I made it a point to use the command line to send updates to git.
* Refreshed my memory regarding the different Bootstrap classes.
* How to make the background color of the Navbar when scrolled.

## What I Could Improve

I think this project could have used less IDs for styling and more contrast between the background color and the text.
